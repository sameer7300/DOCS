# Decentralized Data Marketplace with Built-In ML Training

## Vision & Concept
A blockchain-powered marketplace where users can upload, buy, and sell datasets, and train ML models directly within the ecosystem. Payments are done using a native token (**DATACOIN**), and blockchain ensures transparency, immutability, and fairness.

---

## Target Users
- AI/ML developers & researchers  
- Data providers (startups, individuals, research labs)  
- Blockchain & crypto enthusiasts  
- Small businesses/startups needing affordable datasets  

---

## Features
- Dataset upload (CSV, JSON, AI-ready datasets)  
- Marketplace payments with DATACOIN (ERC-20 token)  
- ML training inside the ecosystem (PyTorch/TensorFlow)  
- Blockchain transparency (immutable logs for training/purchases)  
- Decentralized storage with IPFS/Filecoin  

---

## System Architecture

### Frontend (dApp)
- React.js + Next.js  
- Wallet integration (MetaMask, WalletConnect)  
- Dataset browsing & purchases  
- Training job requests  

### Backend (Application Layer)
- Django (Python)  
- REST/GraphQL APIs for frontend  
- Manages metadata, user profiles, dataset indexing  
- Orchestrates ML training pipelines (Dockerized PyTorch/TensorFlow)  
- Blockchain integration with `web3.py`  

### Blockchain Layer
- Solidity smart contracts  
- ERC-20 DATACOIN  
- Contracts for payments, dataset ownership, ML training logs  

### Storage Layer
- IPFS/Filecoin for dataset & model storage  
- PostgreSQL for off-chain metadata  

---

## Security Protocols
- Wallet authentication with MetaMask/WalletConnect  
- Smart contract auditing (OpenZeppelin standards)  
- Dataset integrity with IPFS hashes  
- Sandboxed ML training environments (Docker)  
- HTTPS/TLS encryption for frontend/backend  

---

## Tokenomics
- **Token Name:** DATACOIN  
- **Standard:** ERC-20  
- **Utility:**  
  - Buy datasets  
  - Pay for ML training jobs  
  - Stake for governance/voting  
- **Value Drivers:** dataset demand, token scarcity, liquidity, adoption

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 – MVP (3-4 months)
- Deploy DATACOIN  
- Build React + Next.js frontend  
- Dataset upload/download with IPFS  
- Basic Django backend with user profiles  
- Smart contract payment system  

### Phase 2 – ML Integration (4-6 months)
- ML training pipelines (PyTorch/TensorFlow)  
- On-chain ML logs  
- Token staking for compute  
- Dataset categorization & rating system  

### Phase 3 – Scaling (6-12 months)
- React Native mobile app  
- Cross-chain DATACOIN bridge (Polygon, BNB Chain)  
- Marketplace governance with token voting  
- Monetization for dataset providers (subscriptions/private data)
