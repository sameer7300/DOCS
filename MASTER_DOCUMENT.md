# Decentralized Data Marketplace with Built-In ML Training

---

## Vision & Concept
A blockchain-based ecosystem for buying, selling, and training on datasets. It uses a native token (**NEUROCOIN**) for payments and ensures transparency via blockchain logging.

---

## Target Users
- AI/ML developers & researchers  
- Data providers (individuals, startups, research labs)  
- Blockchain & crypto enthusiasts  
- Startups needing affordable datasets  

---

## Features
- Upload datasets (CSV, JSON, etc.)  
- Purchase datasets using DATACOIN  
- Train ML models inside the ecosystem  
- Immutable blockchain logging for transactions & ML jobs  
- IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized dataset storage  

---

## System Architecture
### Frontend
- React.js + Next.js  
- Wallet integration (MetaMask, WalletConnect)  
- Dataset marketplace UI  

### Backend
- Django (Python)  
- User management, dataset metadata, ML orchestration  
- `web3.py` blockchain integration  

### Blockchain
- Solidity smart contracts  
- ERC-20 DATACOIN token  
- Dataset purchase & training log contracts  

### Storage
- IPFS/Filecoin for datasets & trained models  
- PostgreSQL for off-chain metadata  

---

## Security Protocols
- Wallet-based authentication  
- Smart contract audits  
- Dataset immutability via IPFS  
- Sandboxed ML training environments  
- HTTPS/TLS encryption  

---

## Tokenomics
- **DATACOIN** (ERC-20)  
- Used to:  
  - Buy datasets  
  - Pay for ML training  
  - Stake for governance  
- Value depends on demand, scarcity, and liquidity  

---

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 – MVP
- DATACOIN deployment  
- Basic web dApp  
- IPFS dataset storage  
- Django backend with metadata & profiles  

### Phase 2 – ML Integration
- ML training pipelines  
- Blockchain logs for training  
- Token staking for compute  

### Phase 3 – Scaling
- Mobile app (React Native)  
- Cross-chain token support  
- Marketplace governance features

## Non-Technical User Proposal
**Problem:** AI developers lack affordable, transparent datasets.  
**Solution:** A blockchain-powered marketplace for data & ML training.  
**Why It Matters:** Fair rewards, transparency, and new economy for data.  

---

## Payment & Conversion Flows
- Users buy DATACOIN with crypto (ETH, BNB, USDT).  
- Buyers use DATACOIN to purchase datasets.  
- Sellers earn DATACOIN and can swap it back into other crypto.  

---

## Platform Strategy
- **Web-first (React + Django + Solidity + IPFS)**  
- Expand later into **mobile apps** (React Native).  
- Keep it blockchain-native with DATACOIN as the core token.
