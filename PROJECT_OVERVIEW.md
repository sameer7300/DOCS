# NeuroData: Decentralized Data Marketplace with Built-In ML Training

---

## 🌍 What is it?

A blockchain-based platform where:

- **Data Providers** can upload datasets (CSV, JSON, small structured data).
- **Data Buyers** (researchers, businesses, developers) purchase datasets using platform tokens (**NeuroCoin - NRC**).
- **ML Models** are trained within the marketplace on purchased datasets, without relying on external models.
- **Blockchain** logs everything immutably — dataset uploads, purchases, training runs, model versions, etc.

This creates a **trustless, transparent ecosystem** for data exchange + ML.

## 👥 End Users

### Data Providers (Sellers)
- Upload datasets securely.
- Get rewarded in NeuroCoin whenever their dataset is purchased.
- Track how often their data is used for ML training.

### Data Consumers (Buyers)
- Purchase datasets with tokens.
- Optionally train ML models on the purchased datasets directly within the platform.
- Benefit from blockchain-logged training runs for reproducibility.

### ML Developers / Researchers
- Train models inside the platform (instead of external environments).
- Compare models trained on the same dataset (fair benchmarking).
- Publish models back to the marketplace (optional).

### Platform / Community (Validators)
- Validate dataset integrity (not corrupted, meets schema).
- Validate ML training runs (correct execution, not faked).
- Earn rewards for keeping the system honest.

## 🔒 Security Protocols

### Data Security
- Datasets are encrypted before upload.
- Access granted only after purchase (using tokenized smart contracts).
- Use IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized storage.

### Smart Contract Security
- Dataset purchase, payment, and access controlled via smart contracts.
- Escrow mechanism: tokens only released to seller after buyer confirms access.
- Immutable logs: no one can fake a sale or alter transaction history.

### Model Training Security
- Training jobs run in sandboxed environments (Dockerized nodes).
- Every run is hashed and logged on blockchain.
- Models are versioned with cryptographic hashes.

### Consensus + Validation
Validators check:
- Dataset metadata validity (hash matches).
- ML training reproducibility (re-run training on sample subset to confirm results).
- **Proof-of-Validation (PoV)** consensus mechanism.

### User Privacy
- Private datasets shared only with buyers.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** can prove dataset existence without revealing it.
- **Homomorphic encryption** (advanced) → models trained on encrypted data.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Workflow)

### 1. Data Upload (Provider Side)
- Provider encrypts dataset → Uploads to IPFS/Filecoin.
- Metadata (hash, size, schema, price) → Written to blockchain.

### 2. Data Purchase (Buyer Side)
- Buyer browses marketplace → Chooses dataset → Pays with NeuroCoin.
- Smart contract releases decryption key → Buyer gains access.

### 3. ML Training (On Platform)
- Buyer selects dataset + ML algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree).
- Training job runs on decentralized compute nodes.
- Results + model weights + logs → Recorded immutably on blockchain.

### 4. Model Publishing (Optional)
- Buyers can publish trained models back to marketplace.
- Others may buy pre-trained models instead of raw data.

## 💡 Example Use Case

- A medical researcher uploads a small anonymized dataset of heart patients.  
- A health-tech startup buys it using NeuroCoin.  
- They train a logistic regression classifier inside the platform.  
- The training run + results are logged immutably → reproducible research.  
- The trained model is resold in the marketplace, earning **passive income** for the startup.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Blockchain Layer
- Ethereum / Polygon / Hyperledger Fabric  
- Smart Contracts in Solidity  
- NeuroCoin (NRC) → ERC-20 token  

### Storage
- IPFS + Filecoin for dataset storage  

### ML Engine
- Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch with small models)  
- Sandboxed execution using Dockerized workers  

### Compute Layer
- Decentralized compute (Akash / Ankr / custom worker nodes)  

### Frontend
- React + TailwindCSS  
- Web3.js / Ethers.js for blockchain interaction  

### Backend
- Django + Django REST Framework  
- PostgreSQL for user/dataset metadata  
- Celery + Redis for training job scheduling  

---

## 🚧 Challenges (and why it’s unique)
- ML models must be lightweight to run inside decentralized environments.  
- Designing **fair rewards** for dataset providers & validators.  
- Ensuring dataset **authenticity & reproducibility** without leaking private info.  

---

## ✅ End Result

A trustless marketplace where:  
- **Data** = a tradeable asset  
- **ML training** = transparent, reproducible process  
- **Blockchain** = ensures integrity, payments, and fairness  

Basically: **“Kaggle + OpenSea + Decentralized ML Training”**.
