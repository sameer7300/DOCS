# NeuroData Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development of **NeuroData**, a decentralized data marketplace with integrated machine learning, powered by **NeuroCoin (NRC)**.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1–3)
**Goal:** Build the core marketplace with blockchain payments.

### Milestones
- ✅ Define architecture (frontend, backend, blockchain, ML)
- ✅ Setup GitHub repo, CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Docker)
- ✅ Deploy Django backend with DRF
- ✅ Implement PostgreSQL for user & dataset metadata
- ✅ Integrate IPFS for dataset storage
- ✅ Build React frontend (dataset upload, browsing, wallet connection)
- ✅ Deploy NeuroCoin (ERC-20) smart contract on Polygon testnet
- ✅ Implement payments: buy datasets using NeuroCoin
- ✅ Smart contract logging for dataset purchases
- ✅ Basic security: JWT auth, password hashing, dataset encryption

---

## Phase 2: Machine Learning Integration (Months 4–8)
**Goal:** Enable ML model training on datasets inside the ecosystem.

### Milestones
- ✅ Setup ML sandbox (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- ✅ Enable user-triggered training runs on purchased datasets
- ✅ Log ML runs & results immutably on blockchain
- ✅ Add visualizations (Matplotlib/Seaborn) for training results
- ✅ Support common ML tasks:
  - Classification
  - Regression
  - Clustering
- ✅ Add Celery + Redis for background ML jobs
- ✅ Dataset reputation system (ratings, feedback)
- ✅ Frontend UI for ML experiment history

---

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion (Months 9–14)
**Goal:** Enhance usability, scalability, and ecosystem reach.

### Milestones
- ✅ Deploy NeuroCoin on Polygon mainnet
- ✅ Token integration with decentralized exchanges (DEX listing)
- ✅ Optimize IPFS storage (Pinata / Web3.Storage pinning)
- ✅ Advanced security: sandboxed ML execution, stricter smart contract audits
- ✅ Enhanced user dashboards (dataset sales, earnings, training analytics)
- ✅ Community voting system for dataset quality (DAO-style governance)
- ✅ Multi-wallet support (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet)

---

## Phase 4: Growth & Mobile (Months 15–20)
**Goal:** Broaden access, mobile-first adoption.

### Milestones
- ✅ Launch React Native mobile app (iOS & Android)
- ✅ Push notifications for dataset sales, ML results
- ✅ Fiat on-ramp integration (buy NeuroCoin with credit card / PayPal)
- ✅ Partnerships with universities & research institutions
- ✅ Initial API release for 3rd-party developers

---

## Phase 5: Long-Term Vision (Months 21+)
**Goal:** Establish NeuroData as the go-to decentralized AI-data marketplace.

### Milestones
- ✅ Advanced ML models (deep learning with PyTorch)
- ✅ Federated learning features (privacy-preserving ML)
- ✅ On-chain governance: token-based voting on platform decisions
- ✅ Staking rewards for holding NeuroCoin
- ✅ Enterprise integrations (startups, research labs, NGOs)
- ✅ Community hackathons & ecosystem grants program

---

## Summary Timeline
- **Months 1–3** → Core marketplace + NeuroCoin payments  
- **Months 4–8** → ML integration (training + logging)  
- **Months 9–14** → Ecosystem scaling, token launch  
- **Months 15–20** → Mobile + fiat payments  
- **Months 21+** → Advanced ML + governance + enterprise adoption
