# The Point of the Project

## ✅ Problems It Solves

### Trust in Data Sharing  
Today, if you buy a dataset from someone, how do you know it hasn’t been tampered with or misrepresented?  
➡️ Blockchain ensures dataset authenticity & integrity (hashes don’t lie).

### Fair Compensation for Data Owners  
Right now, researchers, companies, or even individuals often give away data for free or lose control of it.  
➡️ This marketplace guarantees automatic payments via smart contracts every time their data is used.

### Accessibility of Data for ML  
Good datasets are either locked inside big corporations (Google, Amazon, Meta) or cost thousands of dollars.  
➡️ This system creates a global open marketplace, making datasets affordable and accessible.

### Reproducibility in Machine Learning  
A huge issue in AI research: many published results cannot be reproduced because data and training runs aren’t transparent.  
➡️ By logging every training run immutably on blockchain → you get verifiable, reproducible ML experiments.

### Decentralization of AI Development  
Today, AI is monopolized by a few tech giants.  
➡️ This project lowers the barrier for independent developers, startups, and researchers to train and share models openly.

## 🚫 Problems It Won’t Solve (Limitations)

- It won’t compete with Google-sized ML models (too heavy for on-chain or small decentralized systems).  
- Privacy-sensitive data (like medical records) would still require careful anonymization before uploading.  
- Market success depends on whether enough people actually want to buy/sell data in a decentralized way.

## 💡 Who Benefits (End Users in Real Life)

- **Researchers** → Can access affordable datasets + verifiable training logs.  
- **Data owners (companies, labs, NGOs, individuals)** → Earn tokens from their data instead of giving it away.  
- **Startups** → Get ready-to-use datasets/models without expensive licenses.  
- **Governments & NGOs** → Share public datasets with built-in transparency.  
- **Students / Learners** → Get datasets + models to practice ML on, without needing hidden corporate datasets.

## 🌍 Impact

- **Democratizes AI** → Data is no longer locked up in silos.  
- **Creates a new economy** → Data and models as digital assets, just like NFTs but with real utility.  
- **Improves trust in AI research** → Anyone can verify if a model was really trained on the claimed dataset.

## ✅ So Does It Solve Problems?

Yes — it solves **data access, fairness, reproducibility, and trust** problems in the AI world.  

⚠️ But note → it’s **not for everyday casual users**.  
It’s targeted at **researchers, developers, startups, and organizations** who deal with **data + ML**.
