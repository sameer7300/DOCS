- **Sell your data** and earn NCR tokens
- **Transfer money instantly** without banks
- **Pay lower fees** than credit cards

- 🌍 **Geographic limits** (some countries can't use certain cards)
- 🔍 **Privacy issues** (banks track all your purchases)

2. **Create account** with strong password
3. **Write down seed phrase** (12 words that recover your wallet)
4. **Add NCR token** to see your balance
5. **You're ready to use NeuroData!**

## 🛒 Step-by-Step: Buying a Dataset (With Escrow Protection)

Let's walk through buying a dataset worth **50 NCR tokens** with our secure escrow system:

### Step 1: Browse and Choose
- **Visit NeuroData marketplace**
- **Browse available datasets** (like shopping on Amazon)
- **Find interesting dataset** priced at 50 NCR
- **Click "Purchase" button**

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet
- **Website asks to connect wallet**
- **Click "Connect MetaMask"**
- **Approve connection** (like logging in)
- **Website can now see your NCR balance**

### Step 3: Confirm Purchase
- **Review purchase details**: Dataset name, price (50 NCR)
- **Check your balance**: Make sure you have enough NCR
- **Click "Confirm Purchase"**
- **MetaMask popup appears**

### Step 4: Approve Transaction
- **MetaMask shows transaction details**
- **Shows gas fee** (small fee for using blockchain, like $1-5)
- **Click "Confirm"** to approve
- **Wait 10-30 seconds** for blockchain confirmation

### Step 5: Escrow Protection Setup
- **50 NCR transferred to smart contract escrow** (not directly to seller)
- **Escrow created automatically** with 24-hour auto-release timer
- **Seller gets notification**: "New order - deliver dataset to release payment"
- **You get confirmation**: "Payment secured in escrow - seller will deliver soon"

### Step 6: Dataset Delivery & Confirmation
- **Seller delivers dataset** and marks as "Delivered"
- **You get notification**: "Dataset ready for download and review"
- **Download and check dataset quality**
- **Two options**:
  - ✅ **Good quality**: Click "Confirm Receipt" → Seller gets 49.5 NCR (50 - 1% fee)
  - ❌ **Poor quality**: Click "Dispute" → Validator reviews → You get refund if valid

### Step 7: Automatic Safety Net
- **If you don't respond within 24 hours**: Escrow automatically releases payment to seller
- **If you dispute**: Neutral validator reviews evidence and decides
- **Complete protection**: You never lose money to bad datasets!

## 🚨 Common Problems and Solutions

### Payment Issues:
### Problem: "I don't have enough NCR"
**Solution:** Buy more NCR with Ethereum, or earn NCR by selling datasets

### Problem: "Transaction failed"
**Solution:** Check if you have enough ETH for gas fees (usually $1-10)

### Problem: "MetaMask not connecting"
**Solution:** Refresh page, make sure MetaMask is unlocked, try different browser

### Problem: "Transaction taking too long"
**Solution:** Blockchain can be slow during busy times, wait 5-10 minutes

### Problem: "I sent NCR to wrong address"
**Solution:** Unfortunately, blockchain transactions can't be reversed. Always double-check addresses!

### Problem: "Can't see my NCR balance"
**Solution:** Add NCR token to MetaMask using our contract address

### Escrow Issues:
### Problem: "I bought dataset but seller hasn't delivered"
**Solution:** Wait 24 hours for auto-release, or contact seller. If no response, dispute the transaction.

### Problem: "Dataset is corrupted/fake, what do I do?"
**Solution:** Click "Dispute" within 7 days, provide evidence (screenshots, error messages), validator will review and refund if valid.

### Problem: "I confirmed receipt by mistake"
**Solution:** Unfortunately, confirmations are final. Always review datasets before confirming.

### Problem: "Seller is asking for direct payment outside escrow"
**Solution:** Never do this! This bypasses protection. Report the seller to platform administrators.

### Problem: "My dispute was rejected, but dataset is really bad"
**Solution:** You can appeal to senior validators with additional evidence within 48 hours.

### Problem: "Escrow auto-released but I never got the dataset"
**Solution:** Contact support immediately. Auto-release only happens after seller marks as delivered.
